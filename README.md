Hello Challenge Group 1 Team 1! Â 

I know there are a lot of challenges, so teamwork is important.

A lot of the challenges are open-ended in nature to see your creativity, communication, technical proficiency and teamwork skills, we will be looking out for individuals who showcase these skills the most during the hackathon. Good luck everyone!
